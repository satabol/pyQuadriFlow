## Description

This project is a Python wrapper of https://github.com/Satabol/QuadriFlow (is a fork of https://github.com/hjwdzh/QuadriFlow with minor). Quadriflow used in Blender:

![image](https://github.com/satabol/QuadriFlow/assets/14288520/56dd4baf-284f-4cbb-b866-61b434e44b1b)

and has no python api for bmesh.

Now this wrapper is used by a Blender addon [Sverchok](https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok) for a node "quadriflow":

![image](https://github.com/satabol/QuadriFlow/assets/14288520/8fe337c4-d84a-4d5f-9c1e-34a4cb78f05f)

but you can use it apart of Blender:

```
pip install pyQuadriFlow
```

Usage:
```
import pyQuadriFlow
pyquadriflow(
        faces,  # How many faces you need
        seed,   # random seed
        mesh_vertices, # mesh vertices [ [x0,y0,z0], [x1,y1,z1], ...]
        face_indexes,  # list of face indices as triangles: [[0,1,2],[1,2,3],...]
        flag_preserve_sharp,
        flag_preserve_boundary,
        flag_adaptive_scale,
        flag_aggresive_sat,
        flag_minimum_cost_flow
    )
```

If you use this function apart of Blender you have to do triangulation before call this function. But Blender node **quadrimesh** do traingulation before call this function.

## Dependency

This project has dependency of https://github.com/satabol/quadriflow and to build this library you have to build quadriflow library first.

## Build for Windows

After a build of https://github.com/satabol/quadriflow you can continue build this repository. Clone this repository to some folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/satabol/pyQuadriFlow.git
```

![image](https://github.com/satabol/QuadriFlow/assets/14288520/6c7953c6-06c0-4356-9694-2f61a912179c)

Now open this project with Visual Studio 2022 and check some dependencies of the project and correct these settings to you paths:

![image](https://github.com/satabol/QuadriFlow/assets/14288520/6bb47366-bdb9-4b2c-a43f-f43f9eda8835)

Now you can build the project:

![image](https://github.com/satabol/QuadriFlow/assets/14288520/5f635fd2-e8e5-4264-8957-6f9f89938d55)

If all good you get a file with a name **ctypes_QuadriFlow.dll** It is a first file for package.

Now lets build a library static file (**ctypes_QuadriFlow.so**) for Linux...

## Build for Linux

Clone this repository to some linux folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/satabol/pyQuadriFlow.git
```

![image](https://github.com/satabol/QuadriFlow/assets/14288520/c73975ec-f9db-4bf0-809b-25c947772dc1)

Run command to build library:

```
g++ ctypes_QuadriFlow.cpp -L/opt/github.com/quadriflow/build -l:libquadriflow.a -I /opt/github.com/quadriflow/src -I /opt/github.com/eigen/build/include/include/eigen3 -o ctypes_QuadriFlow.so -fPIC -shared
```

![image](https://github.com/satabol/QuadriFlow/assets/14288520/405c5763-2f13-4c27-b592-9eeebf880c6f)


## Result


Now you have two libraries for the Python package pyQuadriFlow.
Copy them into the package clib folder:

![image](https://github.com/satabol/QuadriFlow/assets/14288520/eca1f40c-b4ab-41a7-bb6c-589f0adace1d)

Your python package is ready.

## Test in Sverchok

To install this package into the Blender python package repository:

```
"E:\install\Blender\blender-3.6.12-windows-x64\3.6\python\Scripts\pip.exe" install .
```

![image](https://github.com/satabol/QuadriFlow/assets/14288520/cc2c5577-f53c-449c-bde6-04fbed09a521)

Now start the Blender and try to import this package:

```
import pyQuadriFlow
```

![image](https://github.com/satabol/QuadriFlow/assets/14288520/4cea4879-4dc9-4b92-85ab-a4f5e528bf66)

Now lets try use a node **quadriflow** in [Sverchok](https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok):

![image](https://github.com/satabol/QuadriFlow/assets/14288520/1eac54bb-5a6f-4583-b73a-7295cd452860)

One yet example:

## WARNING

This function is a very time consumer!!! So apply this carefully.
